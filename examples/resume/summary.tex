I’m an Italian freelance consultant specializing in Android development, with a strong track
record of delivering high-quality, maintainable mobile applications.
While my core expertise lies in Android, I’m quick to adapt to new languages and technologies when needed, always
focusing on pragmatic solutions and efficient processes.

I take a customer-first approach to development, I’ve actively supported
customer service teams, joined in handling tickets, and monitored social media to better understand
user pain points and how our apps were received in the real world.

Beyond coding, I regularly moderate retrospectives, planning, and other team ceremoniest.
In my most recent role, I often owned tasks from start to finish: defining scope, identifying
what could be simplified, coordinating across teams, and ensuring timely delivery.
I enjoy working in cross-functional environments where I can take initiative and help connect
the dots between users, developers, and business goals.
